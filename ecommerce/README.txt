This is an ecommerce website where customers/users can buy things, similar to Amazon, Aliexpress.
It is a free-course related website and it was built using HTML, CSS, PHP, PhpMyAdmin and MySQL. 
The project is not finished because PayPal developer API is needed and I still cannot make a PayPal account because I am 
born in 1999. The project is not launched, it can be tested locally using XAMPP local web server application ( https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html ).
